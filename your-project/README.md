## Project Description
How many of us have experienced watching a cycling competition on TV, at 3PM, in summer, after a huge family gathering? Yes, I also didn’t understand the hype old people (at the time) had around this sport. Yes, I also fell asleep.
What we probably didn’t expect was that after some years, some of us would also be one of this weird old people to put on some fancy workout clothes and go cycling for an entire morning feeling awesome. That’s why we wanted to understand how people exercise in Spain, how pro athletes in cycling behave and if there is any relationship between these two variables and the amount of medals a country wins in the Olympic games.

## Questions & Hypotheses
region.
**1. Pro athletes by country vs. medals in the Olympic games:** is the amount of Strava’s pro athletes per country related to the amount of medals that same region gets in the Olympic games?
**2. Pro athletes activity vs. number of followers:** analysis of the relationship between the number of followers and the activity frequency of Strava’s pro athletes.
**3. Sports frequency in Spain:** analysis of the percentage of total population that regularly practices sports by autonomous community, age group and employment situation.


## Dataset
- [INE (CSV’s)](http://estadisticas.mecd.gob.es/DeporteDynPx/deportebase/index.htm?type=pcaxis&path=/d12/f12/a2015/C03/&file=pcaxis)
- [Strava (web scraping)](https://www.strava.com/pros)
- [Github - Olympic games](https://github.com/flother/rio2016)

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other?

## Workflow
1. **Brainstorming of different topics and questions**
2. **Choice of our topic**
3. **Data research on the topic**
4. **Web scraping and data cleaning**
5. **Data analysis and plotting**
6. **Preparation of the article, presentation, ERD and Readme file**

## Organization
We used a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/4Sxpvoy2/project-3-data-thieves) to organize our workflow.

Our repository has the following folders:
- **Sources:** folder with all the raw data that we extracted.
- **Code:** folder with all our analysis, with a folder for each data analyst.
- **Outputs:** folder with all the outputs of our project (images, Excel files and article).
